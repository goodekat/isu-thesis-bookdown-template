\section{Overview}

The  construct of this section or any further section is same as the authors paper.
This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which
explains in general terms the concepts and hypothesis
which will be used in my thesis.

With more general information given here than really
necessary.

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

\cite{allen}, \cite{bruner} and \cite{cox}
did the initial work in this area. But in Struss' work [\cite{struss}]
the definitive model is seen.

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is 
currently being explained is examined and particular
elements of that part are given careful scrutiny.
